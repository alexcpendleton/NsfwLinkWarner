# NsfwLinkWarner
Aims to be a URL forwarder that lets the user know they are about to click on a link deemed not safe for work. 

Folks in chat rooms sometimes don't pay much attention to NSFW warnings around links. By posting a URL similar to http://nsfwnsfw.com/NSFW_hash_NSFW it will hopefully be more noticeable.

This is a work in progress, and not ready to be used. It may never be a public service.
